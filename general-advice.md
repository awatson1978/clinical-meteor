Here are some general tips and advice on writing Meteor applications.

- First and foremost, make sure to use an IDE that supports refactoring javascript, such as WebStorm.  Think more organically, and try to grow your application, rather than engineer it.  Discover the correct syntax through refactoring, rather than assume a 'best practices' approach or try to force Meteor to work like an object-oriented framework.  Meteor is a different breed of framework, and simply works differently than object-oriented LAMP stacks.  There's this whole concept of scoping, and you'll find yourself constantly moving things around to fit into different scopes.  That moving of things around makes refactoring tools invaluable.  

- Be aggressive about offloading object structure into .less files, when possible.  The LESS precompiled supports @import statements, and can be used to create dependencies between files.  More importantly, CSS can be used to create class inheritance structures.  If you're inclined to use class inheritance, try doing it with CSS instead of Javascript.   And the more functionality that is offloaded into CSS, that's less functionality that you have to manage in Javascript (sorry for the pun). 

- Create a packages directory in the root directory, and refactor code out of your application into reusable modular packages.  Packages support some semblance of dependency tracking through the api.use() command.  You can create some semblance of javascript namespacing and dependency loading using packages.  This took care of another 40% of the problems with load ordering.

- Rethink your usage of objects and inheritance.  Javascript is a functional language, at its core.  In my experience, one gets way more milage out of creating Monads, rather than Classes.  Creating class hierarchies is a good way to get frustrated with Meteor.   Most of what you're trying to do with class inheritance, to create various types of widgets, can be done with a monad decorator pattern.  Generally speaking, the fewer objects you create on the heap, the happier you'll be.  

- Rethink what you know about MVC patterns, and what you have to do to implement them.   Generically speaking, HTML is for the (Document Object) Model, CSS is for the View, and Javascript is for the Controllers.  Meteor is already taking care of most of the plumbing and wiring.  Don't reimplement what already exists with Backbone, Angular, Ember, Knockout, or any of the other MVC frameworks.  All that functionality is already baked into Meteor.  Learn to use the existing feature set.

- Embrace the global scope through the use of Session.get() and Session.set(), complex_session_variable_names, and camelCaseSyntax.  Once you get accustomed to doing things like Session.set('current_page', '#profilePage') and Session.get('is_sidebar_visible') in the global scope, the entire framework becomes *sooo* much simpler to use. 

- Also, if you get into the habit of creating complex function names like toggleSessionObjects(objectId), rather than abbreviated names like tog(o), you can safely and comfortably use the global namespace for javascript functions without worrying about name collisions.  That really helps in reducing problems with load ordering.

- And finally, I recommend not using the filesystem as a namespace for Classes, as you may be accustomed to in object-oriented frameworks.  Use the filesystem as a namespace for Workflow components instead...  pages, modaldialogs, importers, reports, etc.  I find that the workflow components namespace generally gets replicated three times... in the lib, stylesheets, and templates directories, respectively, and reflecting the MVC components.  When refactoring out a package, grab the appropriate file from each of the directories (ie. profile.html, profile.css, profile.js, for example), and put them into a single directory under the packages directory.
