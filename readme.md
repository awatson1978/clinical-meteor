Hi.  Welcome to my Meteor Cookbook, FAQ, and Tutorial, culled from about 9 months of emails and discussions from the [meteor] google group and my experiences rolling out packages and apps.  These documents are intended for the intermediate user learning Meteor, who is accustomed to a) object-oriented frameworks and languages, such as Java and C#, and b) relational databases and data structures derived from SQL table schemas.  The focus is on helping the user grow accustomed to functional programming using document oriented databases.

**Updates 08/31/2013**  
The Cookbook is growing!  It was getting so cumbersome to edit that I split it into a dozen files.  Now have an index!  Also, for those who asked, links from private gmail accounts have been removed to improve readability.

**Community News - 0.6.5**  

With the recent release of version 0.6.5, many applications and packages broke and people are seeing errors all over the place.  Here's a quick rundown on getting apps back up and running again.


````js
//------------------------------------------------------
// application-wide updates using the command line

// try running the following
sudo mrt add standard-app-packages

// if that doesn't work, use a text editor and update the packages file
cd myapp
sudo nano .meteor/packages
> standard-app-packages

//------------------------------------------------------
// debugging errors; updating packages

//TypeError: Object # has no method 'methods'  
//This is caused by a call to ``Meteor.methods()`` in a package.  Add the following added to the ``package.js`` file to fix it.
api.use('standard-app-packages');

//TypeError: Cannot call method 'find' of undefined  
//Same type of error, except to ``Meteor.users.find()``.
api.use('accounts-base');
